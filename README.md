Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Maybe, just maybe, it is a UFO! UFOs, Unidentifiable Flying Objects, have captured the imagination of humans since they were first described in meda and texts. How far this dates depends on who you ask, but some people see recordings of UFOs going back to the dawning of human civiilization! Ancient Aliens, Pyramids. . . I want to believe, and so does Dana! Dana has the dream of working for NASA some day and wants to make a website to log UFO sightings because NASA and Space and Coding. Dana wants to provide visitors to her webpage with detailed filter options so that they may search for what brings them. As a developer, the task put forth was to format the website design so that one could provide a more in-depth search on UFOs!

Here we see a welcoming header, an opening body paragraph, a list of UFO sightings, and search results. All of the information shown on the webpage was formated using a mixture of JavaScript and HTML.

On the far left we see multiple search criteria for people to filter from. From date, city, country and more, this allows our visitors to look more specifically for information regarding UFOs.

When filtered, the large list on the right will be filtered down to a specific result(s). An example of this is if a filter was put in for the city of "Benton" on 1/1/2010 in the US in Arizona.

Using this easy-to-grasp filtering criteria we are able to give visitors access to tailored and easy-to-access information on UFO sightings and information!

### Summary
    
Creating a website design from code alone is proving to be a challenge, there will be no mincing of words here. To consistently nest items within <tr> and <div> functions can become tedious and tiresome, to enter indentation nightmares and references to and from .js and .html files, for issues becoming as difficult and as simple as changing a file's relative location. . . headaches continue to ensue consistently and relentlessly without the slightest of wavering mercy.  

The new design of the website presents itself with sleekness and open accessibility. However, the design has several flaws. To begin, there could be more design variation within the website. With just a header image and a grey background it can easily be deduced that this is a plain website. As well, the website greets you with a large paragraph of information. In a time where most people only read the headline for a news article is it really smart to greet a website visitor with a giant paragraph? As well, a quick glance down brings one to an overwhelming amount of data in a table/array that spans onwards and onwards. This amount of data at the onset of a visit can be intimidating.

In response to the above stated issues, the website's desgn can be improved and developed upon in the following ways:

- Instead of greeting one with a large pararaph, greet visitors with a shorter piece of information such as a famous quite regarding UFOs or a comment by a high-profile individual involed with UFOs. This provides impact in a more concise and easy-to-digest manner
    
- Instead of having the entire table/array of information displayed at the onset of visitation, perhaps only show 1-3 random pieces of information as an example as to not overwhelm visitors while also giving them an idea of what information wiill be returned and in what format
    
- Place the filtering section front-and-center as this is a key part of the website. Placing it to the left is not bad per say, but since a main purpose of the website is hosting and showing UFO information such a search option(s) should be near the forefront of the website
